# Frame Competition
 
Issue ownership theory assumes that the salience of specific issues is always more or less beneficial to a given party. I introduce the concept of "frame competition" and argue that a given issue can be more or less beneficial for parties dependent on the dominant framing. I test this argument using data from the German 2017 election campaign, assessing the similarity of media coverage on migration to the parties' migration framing with topic vectors. Using VAR models, I show whether higher frame similarity is associated with better performance in the polls. The findings broaden our understanding party competition and show parties' capability to compete when the issue agenda is given.
